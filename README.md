# New-BrickPlanet-Clone
this was made out of pure boredom, i am so fucking bored anyways i suggest you not use this and well instead fucking learn to make a site (something im guilty of not doing)

isaac will probably take it down if you use it so be careful and well IG credit me if you use it

# Setup
make a laravel project, upload, php artisan migrate, composer update, composer install and then run
